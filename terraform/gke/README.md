# Terraforming GKE 

## Preface

Most, if not all of the source for terraforming a GKE cluster can be found here from the following repository/author:

I've made slight modifications to the module, such as supporting "google-beta" features.

see: https://github.com/jetstack/terraform-google-gke-cluster/blob/master/example/README.md

To see an example leveraging some of the Google Beta features see the terraform files in this directory.
